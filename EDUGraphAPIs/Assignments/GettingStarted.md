# Microsoft Education Graph Assignments API :  Getting Started

 This document provides information for getting started with assignments API.

 ### Understanding Scopes

 The Assignment Service adds a few new scopes to the **Microsoft Graph**. These scopes are used to access Assignment information.  The scope applies to all the **Assignment** objects including [Assignment](./resources/educationassignment.md), [Resource](./resources/educationresource.md), and [Submission](./resources/educationsubmission.md).  With an App+User Context, the API will only return objects that the user has access to. The "Basic" scopes work the same as the non-basic equivalent scopes, however grade information will not be returned in the Submission objects for "Basic" scopes.

 >**Note:** Students can only access their own Submission.

#### App-Only Context

 ### Understanding assignment Resources

Assignment APIs provide the following key resources:

- [assignment](./resources/educationassignment.md) - **Assignment** is the core object of the Assignments API and owned by the class.
- [Submission](.resources/educationsubmission.md) - **Submission** objects are owned by an assignment. They represents the resources that an individual (or group) submit for an assignment and associated grade/feedback.
- [Resource](resources/educationresource.md) - A resource is associated with an **Assignment** and/or **Submission** and represents the learning object that is being assigned or submitted.

### Building your first app

Read the [Microsoft Graph documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/get-started) for building your first app using assignment APIs.
 
 The [EDUGraphAPI - Office 365 Education Code Sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-EDU-AspNetMVC-Samples) is available from our _GitHub_ repository. Clone the repository to learn about the end to end sample built on Assignments APIs.
